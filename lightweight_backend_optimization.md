# AnkiCollab Backend Lightweight Optimization for Raspberry Pi

## Executive Summary
This document outlines optimizations to make the AnkiCollab backend lightweight and suitable for Raspberry Pi hosting while maintaining core functionality.

## Current Architecture Analysis
- **Backend**: Rust-based server with PostgreSQL database
- **Storage**: S3-compatible object storage for media files
- **Client**: Python plugin with concurrent operations (32 workers max)
- **Key bottlenecks**: Memory usage, database operations, media processing

## Optimization Strategy

### 1. Database Optimizations
- **Switch to SQLite**: Replace PostgreSQL with SQLite for lower memory footprint
- **Connection pooling**: Limit to 2-3 connections max
- **Lazy loading**: Implement on-demand data loading
- **Periodic cleanup**: Automated cleanup of unused data

### 2. Memory Management
- **Reduced worker threads**: Limit to 2-4 workers (vs current 32)
- **Smaller caches**: Implement LRU cache with size limits
- **Streaming operations**: Process large files in chunks
- **Garbage collection**: Aggressive memory cleanup

### 3. Media Processing
- **Async processing**: Move heavy operations to background
- **Local storage**: Option to use local filesystem instead of S3
- **Compression**: More aggressive compression for storage
- **Lazy conversion**: Convert images only when needed

### 4. API Optimizations
- **Rate limiting**: More conservative limits for Pi resources
- **Batch operations**: Group multiple operations
- **Response compression**: Gzip all responses
- **Minimal endpoints**: Remove non-essential features

### 5. Resource Monitoring
- **Memory limits**: Built-in memory usage monitoring
- **CPU throttling**: Automatic slowdown under high load
- **Health checks**: System status endpoints
- **Auto-restart**: Recovery mechanisms

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1-2)
1. Database migration scripts (PostgreSQL â†’ SQLite)
2. Connection pool configuration
3. Memory monitoring implementation
4. Basic Pi-specific configurations

### Phase 2: Media Optimization (Week 3-4)
1. Local storage adapter
2. Streaming file operations
3. Background processing queue
4. Image optimization pipeline

### Phase 3: Client Optimization (Week 5-6)
1. Reduced worker count configuration
2. Smaller cache implementations
3. Better error handling for resource constraints
4. Progressive loading features

### Phase 4: Monitoring & Deployment (Week 7-8)
1. Resource monitoring dashboard
2. Pi-specific deployment scripts
3. Performance benchmarking
4. Documentation and guides

## Expected Benefits
- **Memory usage**: 80-90% reduction (from ~500MB to ~50-100MB)
- **Storage**: Local option eliminates S3 costs
- **Performance**: Optimized for Pi's ARM architecture
- **Reliability**: Better handling of resource constraints
- **Cost**: Significantly lower hosting costs

## Compatibility
- Maintains API compatibility with existing clients
- Gradual migration path available
- Fallback options for critical features
- Backward compatibility for older plugin versions
