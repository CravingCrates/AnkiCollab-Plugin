## Getting a Key

If you know a deck's maintainer, they can give you the subscription key to paste into AnkiCollab.
If you know the deck's name, but don't know the key, go to [AnkiCollab.com/Decks](https://www.ankicollab.com/decks).
On the right, you'll find a search box to help locate the deck.

Click on the deck and the subscription key will be on the top in blue. Copy it.

## Adding the Key to Anki

Open Anki and make sure you're logged in to AnkiCollab.

On the toolbar, click `AnkiCollab ‚Üí Edit Subscriptions`.

![A cursor hovering over the Edit Subscriptions button on the AnkiCollab toolbar tab in Anki.](https://i.imgur.com/vC4fI5n.png)

This window will show all your current subscriptions.

![AnkiCollab's subscription window showing currently subscribed decks.](https://i.imgur.com/srz5ENz.png)

Add a new deck by pasting it into the box at the bottom and clicking **Add Subscription**.

![In the same window, with a new subscription key added.](https://i.imgur.com/gpBov9f.png)

There will be a confirmation and you can now close this window.

The deck may not show up immediately! If you don't see the deck, click the Deck button at the top of the main Anki page to refresh üîÑ the view.

If you see the title of the deck pop up, you are ready to start reviewing! üëç

## Suggesting Changes

### Card Content and Tags

Not every Anki deck is perfect ‚Äî typos, content errors, strange formatting, or other issues might pop up. There might even be some errors in this very document that will get changed in the future!

One huge strength of AnkiCollab is the ability to let the maintainer know that there might be an issue with a deck.

‚ö† In this section, we'll be showing how to change a card's content within the fields, but the process is **identical** for tags.

Let's say you subscribe to a deck and find this card:

![An Anki card in the editor. The front reads "Biggest Animal in the World" and the back reads "Elephant."](https://i.imgur.com/wbKuRPj.png)

Sure, elephants üêò are big, but you *know* that the biggest animal in the world is *actually* a Blue Whale üê≥.

After double-checking that you're correct, change the word Elephant to Blue Whale in the same manner you would edit a normal card.

Once you've edited the card, click the AnkiCollab button.

![A blue arrow pointing to the AnkiCollab button in the Anki editor window.](https://i.imgur.com/dE9uEOW.png)

A small window will pop up and ask you to choose a rationale for making this change.

![A small pop up window with a dropdown box of various reasons for suggesting a change.](https://i.imgur.com/OhLwRH4.png)

In our case, let's choose **Content Error**. Next, click **OK**.

You've now submitted your first change!

From the maintainer's point of view, they'll see a window like this:

![On the AnkiCollab website showing the maintainer's options for reviewing suggestions.](https://i.imgur.com/aZBo31A.png)

This page tells the maintainer what exactly was changed and why.

From here, they can approve or reject your suggestion. If approved, everyone who subscribed to this deck will receive an update with your change.

You are now ready to go into the AnkiCollab world and improve decks! üëç

### New Cards

Some decks on AnkiCollab are unfinished, looking for people to contribute and finish them. In this case, you don't want to be *editing* cards, but *adding* new ones.

‚ö†Ô∏è Before you start adding cards, make sure you are adding them to the correct deck!

Let's say you subscribed to a Flower Identification deck, but they're missing the California Poppy. When adding the card, all you have to do is check the Suggest on AnkiCollab button toward the bottom.

![Blue arrow pointing to the Suggest on AnkiCollab buttom at the bottom of the Add window.](https://i.imgur.com/HvJM2Fn.png)

Now you just need to wait for the maintainer to approve your card!

## Downloading Updates

To download any changes or new content for your subscribed deck, you can manually check for new content or automatically check for updates on startup.

### Check for New Content Manually

On the toolbar, click `AnkiCollab ‚Üí Check for New Content`.

![A cursor hovering over the Check for New Content button on the AnkiCollab toolbar tab in Anki.](https://i.imgur.com/dtxRALy.png)

This will retrieve any available updates for your subscription.

If any updates are available, you will be shown the changelog and asked if you want to Install Now, Skip this Update, or Decide Later.
